## Architectural 
To do this exercise I decided to use the Model-View-Controlle [MVC](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mvc_framework/mvc_framework_introduction.htm), which is one of the most frequently used industry-standard. 

## Steps
We are going to look at the steps I take to solve the problem

- `Read the file`
- `Convert it an object`
- `Get the employee and the next one`
- `Compare entry time of the next employee with the exit time of the first     employee and compares the entry time of the first employee with the exit time of the second employee `
- `count the times they meet`
- `Render the result`
